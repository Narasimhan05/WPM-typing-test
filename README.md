# Typing Speed Test (WPM)

A simple Python project to measure your typing speed in words per minute (WPM). This script presents a random sentence, tracks the time you take to type it, and calculates your WPM.

## Features

- Random sentence generation for typing practice.
- Accurate WPM calculation.
- Error highlighting to improve typing accuracy.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Required libraries:
  - `random`
  - `time`
  - `colorama` (for colored output)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/wpm-typing-test.git
   cd wpm-typing-test
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

Run the script to start the typing test:

```bash
python typing_test.py
```

Follow the on-screen instructions:
1. A random sentence will appear on the screen.
2. Type the sentence exactly as it appears.
3. Press Enter to submit your input.

The program will calculate your WPM and display your typing accuracy.

## Example Output

```plaintext
Type the following:
The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.

Your input:
The quick bown fox jumps over the laz dog.

Results:
Time taken: 12.3 seconds
